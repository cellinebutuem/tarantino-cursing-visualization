## Cursing and deaths in Tarantino movies - a visual representation
(in progress)

Data visualization python project using [Fivethirtyeight data on cursing and deaths in Tarantino movies](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/tarantino) and seaborn library to plot some nice charts and check if Tarantino's fame for violent movies is well deserved.

### Files
The [tarantino-visual.ipynb](https://github.com/cellinebutuem/tarantino-cursing-visualization/blob/master/tarantino-visual.ipynb) file is a Jupyter notebook with with plots, code, a small analysis of the charts and explanation of the code.
The [tarantino.csv](https://github.com/cellinebutuem/tarantino-cursing-visualization/blob/master/tarantino.csv) contains the dataset from [Fivethirtyeight](https://fivethirtyeight.com).

### Usage
Open [tarantino-visual.ipynb](https://github.com/cellinebutuem/tarantino-cursing-visualization/blob/master/tarantino-visual.ipynb) on github or on [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cellinebutuem/tarantino-cursing-visualization/blob/master/tarantino-visual.ipynb), however the last plot is interactive (ipywidgets) and will not work either way. In order to see (and interact with) the plots you need to download the notebook and data and run all the cells.
